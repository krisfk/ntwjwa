                    We believe that the family is of vital importance to personal development hence providing family
                    services, such as supportive integration services in nursery, temporary/ day care services and
                    developmental parent-child education and parent-child activities shall, in a long run strengthen the
                    family unit. We also endeavour to provide different forms of services for specific needs, such as
                    community care facilities for ageing family members. The modern social problem is complex and often
                    requires more resources and more professional intervention before conflicts or challenges can be
                    resolved. Community-based solutions can be applied via organizing activities in communal areas,
                    strengthening civic awareness of the residents of the area, building a sense of community family
                    also
                    requires individual involvements. </div>
